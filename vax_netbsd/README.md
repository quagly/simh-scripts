# install netbsd 10 on vax
using the vax binary which emulates vax3900

I want to install a current system to have the os tools to help diagnose vax issues.

Following [netbsd-simh](https://github.com/kernelzeroday/netbsd-simh)
and [netbsd-vax](https://www.netbsd.org/ports/vax/emulator-howto.html)
which are almost the same instructions
